# oh-my-posh-themes
Lately I've been playing with oh-my-posh themes and I created my own to fullfill my needs. I tested it on PowerShell core and Wsl2/Ubuntu

It shows current:
- SO
- user
- folder(with link to open it on explorer.exe)
- git info
- red seccion if command returned error
- it also shows a lightning when it runs as administrator
